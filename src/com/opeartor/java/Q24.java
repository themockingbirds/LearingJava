To determine whether a year is a leap year, follow these steps:
1. If the year is evenly divisible by 4, go to step 2 Otherwise, go to step 5.
2. If the year is evenly divisible by 100, go to step 3 Otherwise, go to step 4.
3. If the year is evenly divisible by 400, go to step 4 Otherwise, go to step 5.
4. The year is a leap year (it has 366 days). The method isLeapYear needs to return true.
5. The year is not a leap year (it has 365 days). The method isLeapYear needs to return false.

The following years are not leap years:
1700, 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300, 2500, 2600
This is because they are evenly divisible by 100 but not by 400.

The following years are leap years:
1600, 2000, 2400
This is because they are evenly divisible by both 100 and 400.
